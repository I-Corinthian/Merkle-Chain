# Merkle-Chain
A more sophisticated version of the Merkle Tree data structure that makes use of linked lists is the Merkel Chain. Each node of the linked list is converted into a Merkle Tree in this method, providing several benefits such as zero-knowledge proofs and acting as a Layer 2 (L2) solution. Merkel Chain offers improved functionality and is suitable for a variety of uses.

Merkel Chain is appropriate for zero-knowledge proofs since it efficiently verifies data consistency and integrity by utilising the Merkle Tree structure. Additionally, the data structure is simple to traverse and manipulate thanks to its linked list form, enabling quicker and more flexible operations.

Merkel Chain also has the potential to act as a Layer 2 solution for blockchain systems, delivering scalability and enhanced performance. The Merkle Chain can be used in Layer 2 protocols to offload some processing and storage tasks from the primary blockchain, reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs.

In conclusion, Merkel Chain is a Layer 2 implementation of the Merkle Tree that uses linked lists and offers capabilities like zero-knowledge proofs. It improves data integrity verification, facilitates effective data traversal, and may enhance blockchain systems' scalability and performance.
